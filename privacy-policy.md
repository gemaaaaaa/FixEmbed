# FixEmbed Privacy Policy

Last updated and effective: June 26, 2024

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot FixEmbed#5654.

By default, FixEmbed does not store any data. If a server member with the Manage Server permission uses the <code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> command to change the bot’s state of the channel, then the server’s automatically-generated Discord ID (for example, <code>398998849026261003</code>) will be stored in the bot’s array along with the provided state. No other data relating to the server is stored. FixEmbed never stores data specific to users.

The state of the channel data is stored only for the bot to function and is not shared with anyone else or used for any other reason. The data is stored on locally.

To contact me ([Kenneth Hendricks](https://github.com/kenhendricks00)), the developer of FixEmbed, if you want the data to be removed or for any other reason, you can mention strikermonkeyxd (<code>1121099921655865375</code>) in the official [FixEmbed Support Discord server](https://discord.gg/QFxTAmtZdn).

Also see [Discord’s Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

Thanks for using FixEmbed!
