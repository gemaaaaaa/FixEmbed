# FixEmbed Privacy Policy

Last updated and effective: July 8, 2024

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot FixEmbed#5654.

By default, FixEmbed does not store any data. If a server member with the Manage Server permission uses the <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code> command to change the bot’s state of the channel, then the server’s automatically-generated Discord ID (for example, <code>398998849026261003</code>) will be stored in the bot’s SQL database along with the provided state, this goes for activation/deactivation via the <code>settings</code> command. The conversion service's states are stored in the bot's SQL database as well, so the bot knows what links to convert. No other data relating to the server is stored. FixEmbed never stores data specific to users.

The state of the channel data is stored only for the bot to function and is not shared with anyone else or used for any other reason. The data is stored in a SQL database.

To contact me ([Kenneth Hendricks](https://github.com/kenhendricks00)), the developer of FixEmbed, if you want the data to be removed or for any other reason, you can mention strikermonkeyxd (<code>1121099921655865375</code>) in the official [FixEmbed Support Discord server](https://discord.gg/QFxTAmtZdn).

Also see [Discord’s Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

Thanks for using FixEmbed!
